# A 90's Canto/Mandopop Collection

This is a list of 90's Canto/Mandopop songs compiled by Jason, with gracious markdown and html assistance from April. This html is for a request from Amelie for a playlist related to Faye Wong's 《梦中人》. Given this is under the umbrella of music that I primarily listen to, I wanted to be able to note some special things about each song. I've also wanted to try my hand at creating an html document outside of statistical learning exercises or work for some time now, so I thought I would take the opportunity to do so. Hopefully this collection of songs with notes makes the best use of all that html has to offer.

## 1) Faye Wong/王菲：《梦中人》

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hN2jOHeI5tc" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<iframe style="border-radius:12px" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/1SGPQAdXXDbcRX8kGoBiN3?utm_source=generator" width="30%" height="315" frameBorder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture"></iframe>

**Notes:** Including this one as a point of reference. Amelie requested songs within this vein, and I wanted to give an option of comparing 《梦中人》 with other songs in this html. Also, in case the html ends up being shared and someone doesn't know this song, it's a great Cantonese cover of "Dreams" by the Cranberries. It's well-known from its inclusion in 王家卫/Wong Kar Wai's movie 《重庆森林》/"Chungking Express."

## 2) Faye Wong/王菲：《梦游》

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/V5-rorX6PXk" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<iframe style="border-radius:12px" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/4HJoknGrqGAmx4Uwq1Cuo0?utm_source=generator" width="30%" height="315" frameBorder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture"></iframe>

**Notes:** To my knowledge, this is one of Wong's original songs. It's on the same album as 《梦中人》.

## 3) Dou Wei/窦唯：《高级动物》

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6j6saRRm9B0" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<iframe style="border-radius:12px" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/6M4gwba7uVlM5tfqzb0el8?utm_source=generator" width="30%" height="315" frameBorder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture"></iframe>

**Notes:** It would be hard not to include Dou Wei in a conversation about 90's Chinese music and Faye Wong. Dou Wei is the ex-husband of Faye Wong, with whom he had Leah Dou. He's a great artist in his own right, and was at the forefront of the 90's metal and alternative music scene. Dou Wei doesn't shy from drawing inspiration from Western music, and the influence from Nirvana and Kurt Cobain can be clearly heard in his work.

## 4) Dou Wei/窦唯：《幻听》

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/D2YAycDrp9g" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<iframe style="border-radius:12px" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/34zn8oliFt4yHRyhV6ZPH1?utm_source=generator" width="30%" height="315" frameBorder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture"></iframe>

**Notes:** It was a hard pick between 《高级动物》 and 《幻听》 for inclusion on this list, so I'm also throwing out 《幻听》 as another great Dou Wei song to listen to. I also wanted to note that this song actually came out in 1999.

## 5) Lin Chung/林强：《爱情研究院》

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/m4MVV10YsLk" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<iframe style="border-radius:12px" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/4M6O1LWJdCUG1xPM6Me6qv?utm_source=generator" width="30%" height="315" frameBorder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture"></iframe>

**Notes:** This one song has been in my "On Repeat" mix on Spotfiy for quite some time now. This one is probably thematically the closest to 《梦中人》 in terms of "East meets West alternative;" this song is produced by John Fryer, who also produced Cocteau Twin's "Head Over Heels," among many other albums for many other prominent artists. Fryer's work in the 80's within the dream pop genre really shines through in this song ... is what I could say, but that would be a strong discredit of Lin Chung's musical versatility and genius. Unlike other songs in this collection, this one is sung in Taiwanese dialect.

## 6) Anthony Wong/黄耀明：《春光乍泄》

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/b9Wi_ATz-3E" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9MQqa4ORwI0" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<iframe style="border-radius:12px" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/3RxJEDSivcL87oqDSH5631?utm_source=generator" width="60%" height="315" frameBorder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture"></iframe>

**Notes:** Anthony Wong is considered one of Hong Kong's most iconic gay singers, second only to the late 张国芳/Leslie Cheung. It is thus fitting to select this song, which one might recognize from Wong Kar Wai's movie "Happy Together"/《春光乍泄》 of the same name, in which Cheung starred. Not only that, but Cheung also covers Wong's 《春光乍泄》. Wong has an impressive discography, and between his work from his band 达明一派/Tat Ming Pair and solo endeavors, it was hard to choose just one song to include on this playlist ... so I'm including more.

## 7) Anthony Wong/黄耀明：《每天你爱多一些》

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tG8o5IGs7Po" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<iframe style="border-radius:12px" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/2MLYkdjZYLZOOLUTxGc2hH?utm_source=generator" width="30%" height="315" frameBorder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture"></iframe>

**Notes:** 《每天你多爱一些》 has recently shot up on my "On Repeat" mix as well. It has some truly vibrant 90's visuals that I wanted to include. Unlike the majority of the videos in this html, these videos are successfully embedded.

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/A8BMHYDKy4w" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WZlU3heRfEE" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

**Notes:** Anthony Wong has so many amazing songs that I could make a playlist out of just his songs alone. Some other songs that I think are of note include but are not limited to 《石头记》，《禁色》，《夏娃的第八天》 ... the list could truly go on.

## 8) Jacky Cheung/张学友：《日出时让恋爱终结》

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C3JKKsa_HNU" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<iframe style="border-radius:12px" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/5JkXffg6JX7GLT9Zzug6cD?utm_source=generator" width="30%" height="315" frameBorder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture"></iframe>

**Notes:** Speaking of Wong Kar Wai, Jacky Cheung's 《日出时让恋爱终结》 is mentioned by Takeshi Kaneshiro's character 何志武 in the first half of "Chungking Express." Cheung was also one of the "Four Heavenly Kings" (四大天王), all of whom were pretty big deals in 90's Hong Kong.

## 9) Shirley Kwan/关淑怡：《忘记他》

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-PH7nva1314" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<iframe style="border-radius:12px" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/4BMsm71hl8wqqSbfAdgIHV?utm_source=generator" width="30%" height="315" frameBorder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture"></iframe>

**Notes:** This song was featured in Wong Kar Wai's movie "Fallen Angels"/《堕落天使》. To my knowledge, Shirley Kwan and Jacky Cheung actually have two collaborations together, 《问》 and 《年少无情》, which was the opening for the television series 《蜀山奇侠》.  

## 10) Leon Lai/黎明：《杂念》

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1aSxHAbMMm8" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<iframe style="border-radius:12px" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/6M1A8ezmEzE1Q86lRaucfg?utm_source=generator" width="30%" height="315" frameBorder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture"></iframe>

**Notes:** Funny enough, Shirley Kwan's 《忘记他》 plays in a scene involving Leon Lai, who acts in "Fallen Angels." Lai also belongs to the "Four Heavenly Kings." He also acts in and sings 《杂念》 for "God of Gamblers 3: The Early Stage," the third installment in the iconic "God of Gamblers" movie series.

## 11) Leslie Cheung/张国芳：《追》

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HcSE3cQH-Ic" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/do3NEBHIY2c" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<iframe style="border-radius:12px" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/66cBlqEs1viJJCE74CDfGB?utm_source=generator" width="60%" height="315" frameBorder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture"></iframe>

**Notes:**  One of the late Leslie Cheung's most popular songs on Spotify, which is also featured in Cheung's movie "He's a Man, She's a Woman"/《金枝玉叶》.

## 12） Karen Mok/莫文蔚：《色情男女》

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KRUrmbI1VUQ" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<iframe style="border-radius:12px" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/4awYfIrN3pHyNCsyPG1EGi?utm_source=generator" width="30%" height="315" frameBorder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture"></iframe>

**Notes:** Karen Mok is another famous 90's Hong Kong singer and actress. This particular song is produced by Jason Choi/蔡德才, a frequent producer for Anthony Wong as well, including the two songs listed in this playlist.

**Closing Remarks:** It was definitely fun making this html. I'm also embedding a Spotify playlist with all the songs. I hope this was enjoyable! One thing to note is I wish I could have included more of Hong Kong's famous female singers, like Anita Mui, but most of the other songs I know are a bit on the cheesy side. Maybe I should try my hand at other 90's East Asian music playlists with different themes.
